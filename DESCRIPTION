Description: BAnOCC is a package designed for compositional data,
    where each sample sums to one. It infers the approximate covariance of
    the unconstrained data using a Bayesian model coded with `rstan`. It
    provides as output the `stanfit` object as well as posterior median
    and credible interval estimates for each correlation element.
